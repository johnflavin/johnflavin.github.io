John Flavin is a computer programmer living in St. Louis, MO. He is hard at work on the [Container Service](https://github.com/nrgxnat/container-service) for [XNAT](https://xnat.org). The Container Service lets XNAT users perform custom processing and analysis on their images by launching commands in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.

John has a PhD in physics from Washington University in St. Louis, and BS degrees in physics and mathematics from the University of Missouri â€“ Columbia.

When he has a spare moment, John spends it playing with his son or waking up at 5 am to learn game programming. He has GMed sessions of tabletop role-playing games like [Dungeon World](http://dungeon-world.com/) and [Fiasco](http://bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/). He used to listen to a lot of podcasts, but cut it down to a small core: two actual-play podcasts [The Adventure Zone](http://theadventurezone.tumblr.com/) and [Friends at the Table](http://www.friendsatthetable.net/), and game dev comedy podcast [Coffee with Butterscotch](http://podcast.bscotch.net).

John is an avid cyclist. He rides his bike to work every day. He and his wife completed a Century Ride (100 miles in one day) on October 10, 2010. Yes, this was a 10*10 mile ride on 10-10-10.
