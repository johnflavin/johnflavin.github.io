## Container Service
[Source repo](https://github.com/nrgxnat/container-service)

The container service is a plugin for the [XNAT](http://xnat.org) imaging web application. It integrates a docker application into XNAT, providing new XNAT APIs to launch containers on docker.

This was a multi-year project for me, during which time I wrote almost the entire back end myself. I continue to expand and fix the container service with regular releases, as well as create new docker images to integrate into the service.

## Data Science

### Applied Data Science with Python Specialization

[Coursera site](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)

This is a set of courses on Coursera that I will complete. I do not intend to gain the certification, but I will be working through all the assignments and posting them to a repo on github ([johnflavin/coursera-data-science-python](https://github.com/johnflavin/coursera-data-science-python)).

- [x] Intro to Data Science in Python ([Assignments](https://github.com/johnflavin/coursera-data-science-python/tree/master/01-intro-to-data-science-in-python))
- [x] Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python ([Assignments](https://github.com/johnflavin/coursera-data-science-python/tree/master/02-applied-plotting-charting-and-data-representation-in-python))
- [ ] Applied Machine Learning in Python (In progress)
- [ ] Applied Text Mining in Python
- [ ] Applied Social Network Analysis in Python

## Game projects

### _morseCodeMaster

[Source repo](https://github.com/pizza-quiche/ggj2018)

This was created for the 2018 Global Game Jam, which took place January 26â€“28 2018. The theme that year was "transmission". My team came up with the idea that you, the player, were not directly controlling the character on screen, but were sending him transmissions in Morse code instructing him how to move. To move in any of the four directions (up, down, left, or right) you had to send a Morse code signal for the first letter of the intended direction. You sent these "signals" by pressing the space bar either a short time (a dot) or a long time (a dash). For example, to move the character up you would send the Morse code for the letter U: dot dot dash.

This game was created using Game Maker 2. The jam was the first time I had used this engine, so it was a fun opportunity to learn the engine and the Game Maker Language. (Though learning GML is really more about learning the API they provide than the language syntax itself, but that's a side point.)

My team was made up of two programmers and one artist. I programmed the Morse code input parsing, most of the movement, AI behavior (such as it was), collisions, death, menus, the secret Easter egg, and probably other things I am forgetting. My counterpart did the procedural level generation and manually created another level, sounds, and also probably other stuff.

## Unreal Engine 4 Tutorial

I have completed a game tutorial course on Udemy, [Unreal Engine 4: How to Develop Your First Two Games](https://www.udemy.com/unreale4/learn/v4/overview). Check out my [certificate of completion](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-K6PQGTPM/)!
