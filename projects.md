## Container Service
[Source repo](https://github.com/nrgxnat/container-service)

The container service is a plugin for the [XNAT](http://xnat.org) imaging web application. It integrates a docker application into XNAT, providing new XNAT APIs to launch containers on docker.

This was a multi-year project for me, during which time I wrote almost the entire back end myself. I continue to expand and fix the container service with regular releases, as well as create new docker images to integrate into the service.

## Game projects
I am currently working on my first prototype in Unity. I don't have any completed projects to post yet, but I will be doing so soon.

## Unreal Engine 4 Tutorial

I have completed a game tutorial course on Udemy, [Unreal Engine 4: How to Develop Your First Two Games](https://www.udemy.com/unreale4/learn/v4/overview). Check out my [certificate of completion](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-K6PQGTPM/)!
